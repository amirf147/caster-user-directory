the error was that i was trying to disable all rules except for the ones that i was practicing modifying. after i disabled all rules and then  reenabled them all i wasn't able to do the caster sleep or the caster on commands anymore
what i mean by disabling enabling them i just meant that i set the white list entries to false for all of them and then i set them all back to true
now that i have deleted the user directory and allowed it to be recreated. now i'm trying to figure out what rules are needed to be enabled by the white list for the caster sleep and caster on commands to work
