# caster-user-directory

## Current Status (12 May 2024)
I am still using and developing https://github.com/amirf147/kaldi-dragonfly-gammars for full handsfree computer control. I just created this repository to document/store my Caster user directory (https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/User_Dir/Caster_User_Dir/) as I begin learning and using Caster. It may be that I eventually switch to just using Caster for my computer control needs.

## About Me
I have previously relied on Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and Windows Speech Recognition Macros for using the computer but now I would like to transition away from using these programs. You can view my collection of macros for WSR here: https://github.com/amirf147/wsrmacros. I am new to both Dragonfly and Caster. The final outcome of this transition away from WSR remains to be seen.
