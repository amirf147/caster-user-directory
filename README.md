# caster-user-directory-and-notes

## Current Status (30 May 2024) 
I have added a significant portion of the core customizations that I require for enabling my full time usage of this accessibility tool. I am still switching between usage of kaldi-dragonfly-grammars, wsrmacros and this. I have noticed that there is a little noticeable latency increase when using caster as opposed to just using bare-bones dragonfly but I believe the benefits of using caster will ultimately outweigh this latency increase.

## About Me
I have previously relied on Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and Windows Speech Recognition Macros for using the computer but now I would like to transition away from using these programs. You can view my collection of macros for WSR here: https://github.com/amirf147/wsrmacros. I am new to both Dragonfly and Caster. The final outcome of this transition away from WSR remains to be seen.

## Window Switching
I use numbered win keys for window switching with the following
modifications to the taskbar in Windows 10:
- From windows settings app: Never combine taskbar buttons
- From windows settings app: Vertical taskbar on the right side
- From windows settings app: Small taskbar buttons
- Windhawk mod: "Disable grouping on the taskbar". This prevent the thumbnail preview pop up when you press a windows key plus a number
- Zero pinned items on the taskbar
- Taskbar size minimized using drag-to-resize
